## cgit on Kip

This is the cgit interface running on the "production" git server.

Kip (this server) is used in production in the sense that it is used regularly
for purposes other than just testing out cgit.

This server runs Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver). It is named after Clifford
"Kip" Russell, a character in the 1958 novel *Have Space Suitâ€”Will Travel* by
Robert A. Heinlein.
