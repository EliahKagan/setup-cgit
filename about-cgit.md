## cgit on Apok

This is the cgit interface running on the development git server.

Apok (this server) is used for development -- that is, development of the cgit
instance. It is not the "production" server, not even with the air quotes. Even
if everything works perfectly, the repositories on this server are not current.
They are a stale snapshot.

*Some* features that are made to work on this development server are then
rolled out to the "production" server, Kip.

This server runs Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine), which is itself currently the
development branch of Ubuntu. So it might be considered doubly unstable.

"Apok" is a misspelling of "Apoc," which is in turn a common abbreviation for
"apocalypse" and the name of a character in the 1999 film *The Matrix* by Lana
and Lilly Wachowski. I've been naming computers "Apok" for so long, I don't
remember if there was ever a non-mistaken reason for me to use it, but I know I
did at one time incorrectly believe the character's name was spelled "Apok."
