## cgit on Zim

This is the cgit interface running on the test git server.

Zim (this server) is used for testing. It is not the "production" server, not
even with the air quotes. Even if everything works perfectly, the repositories
on this server are not current. They are a stale snapshot.

This server runs Debian 10 (buster). It is named after Sergeant Charles Zim, a
character in the 1959 novel *Starship Troopers* by Robert A. Heinlein.
